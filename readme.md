# Who's In Jail?

A simple node application to put a better interface on the [Yamhill County Jail website](http://www.co.yamhill.or.us/sheriff/inmates/icurrent.htm). It:

* Downloads the main table, and linked inmate profile pages.
* Parses all of the tabular data into JSON
* Presents the data in a more accessable format.

This was built by [Susan Currie Sivek](http://www.susancurriesivek.com/) and [Daniel Bachhuber](http://danielbachhuber.com) during [Code With Me Portland](http://codewithme.us/portland/), a two-day introduction to HTML/CSS/jQuery for journalists.
